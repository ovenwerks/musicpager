	<li>The notes area can have text about the song typed in to help the musician
		remember during performance. If enter is typed after writing and there is a
		current set list, the notes will be remembered with that set.</li>
	<li>The save button will save the note to the current song,</li>
	<li>If the notes are different is the song file and the set list, the notes from
		the set list will be displayed</li>
	<li>Also note that if hot keys are set to letters, it is best to switch tabs away
		from the chart or those keys will still do the hot key function rather than
		input the letter.</li>

<li>
	<p>The set list display and selection area. This drop down normally displays
		the current set list name.</p>

	<p>When selected, it shows all the set lists available. Clicking on one will load
	that list.</p>

<li>
	<p>The exit button exits the application. If the current song has been edited but not saved,
		a dialog will open to remind the user there have been changes and can save before quitting.</p>
