The top bar is visible all the time. It shows and can select the current song.
It allows notes about the song to be shown and edited. It allows the selection of a set list.
Finally, it has an exit button.
<ul>
<li>
	<p>The song selector and display drop down.</p>

		have verse and chorus markings).</li>
	<li>Option to add the current song to the current set list if it is not already there.</li>
	<li>All of the songs in the currently loaded set list.</li>

	<img src="img/Key_and_notes.jpg" width="1099" height="55" alt="">
	<ul>
	<li>The Key label shows the current key with the source file key in braces.</li>
	<li>The notes area can have text about the song typed in to help the musician
		remember during performance. If enter is typed after writing and there is a
		current set list, the notes will be remembered with that set.</li>
	<li>The save button will save the note to the current song,</li>
	<li>If the notes are different is the song file and the set list, the notes from
		the set list will be displayed</li>
	<li>Also note that if hot keys are set to letters, it is best to switch tabs away
		from the chart or those keys will still do the hot key function rather than
		input the letter.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	<p>The set list display and selection area. This drop down normally displays
		the current set list name.</p>
	<img src="img/Set_drop.jpg" width="293" height="263" alt="">
	<p>When selected, it shows all the set lists available. Clicking on one will load
	that list.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>The exit button exits the application. If the current song has been edited but not saved,
		a dialog will open to remind the user there have been changes and can save before quitting.It is
		worth noting that if a song does not have a {key: } tag and the key was guessed, then the
		file has been changed and needs to be saved to keep the key information.</p>
</li>
