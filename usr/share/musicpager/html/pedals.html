<p>The Hotkeys and MIDI control section:</p>

<p>The default hot key setting came from my personal USB pedal which has
	three pedals: a, b and c. Then from there 6 Has ^ above it and v is
	opposite then , has &lt; Depending on the pedal, arrow keys would be
	better. In any case click on the function you wish to change and when
	the dialog opens press the key or pedal you wish to attach to that function
	to set it.</p>

<p>Shifted or modified keys will not work. (who wants to deal with hitting two
	keys in the middle of a song?) Arrow keys can get selected but do not seem to
	work (page up and down do). Yes, this is a bug, but not priority at this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Auto song change checkbox is for use with a two button pedal. At the end
	of the song, an extra page forward will act as a next song and at the beginning
	of the song, the previous page button will go to previous song. Beware this
	can be confusing but if a two button unit is all you have, it will work.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>The midi section is much like the hot key section, select the function and
	press the pedal to send the MIDI event to set. Pressure, pitch bend, and
	keyon with velocity of 0 are filtered out. So keyon, key off, program, CC,
	etc. all work. I found the M-Vave Chocolate Plus is small
	enough to pack while giving useful midi codes out of the box. It is also less
	expensive than many USB pedals.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>First use the MIDI backend to choose between ALSA and Jack. Most modern
	Linux systems with PipeWire have a Jack graph runnnig all the time and will
	show BlueTooth devices that are paired. Then use the device drop down to
	connect to the MIDI device you are using.</p>
