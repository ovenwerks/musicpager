<p>It is often preferable to search for a song by typing in a
	part of the song we remember. The start of a verse or chorus
	for example. Or one may wish to search by author or some
	chordpro files may have a song number in them.</p>
<p>However, if one has a lot of songs, it would take too much
	time to open each file every time we search. So music pager
	does one search at startup and saves the first lines, author
	and song number ready to use for searches.</p>
<p>First we need to know where to search:</p>
<ul>
<li>	<p>The Base folder is where the song files are kept. Click on the button
	to open a folder selector and choose the folder with all your songs in it.</p>
</li>
<li>	<p>The Subfolder Depth determines how far down into sub folders below the
		base folder will be checked. So one can have songs divided in to folders
		labeled with the first letter. A single file can be opened anywhere but
		searches will happen in the base folder and sub folders. If the songs
		are all kept in one folder, set depth to 0.
		</p>
</li>
<li>	<p>The refresh button rebuilds database according to the settings above.
			It is also useful if new song files are added that need to be included
			in the search without having to restart the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
