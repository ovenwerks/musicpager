 This is Notes about developing this application, known bugs and
 features to add. It is generally in order of importance... or at
 least order to be worked on. (some later things rely on sooner
 things)

Features we want:
 - print to PDF
    - probably with html to pdf (started we can load a pdf to a viewer
        which can then print)
    - so add many options to html converter:
        - Lyrics only
        - print/show bass version

 - Import html text
    - Same problems as pdfs except:
        if tabled it's easy, two ways:
            dismantle table
            use just text grab
        if mono spaced quite easy mono should be detectable
        otherwise a conversion to mono is needed. Perhaps a button
            for this.

 - Improve editor
     - Edit in current key but save in default key
     - Allow Change default key
        Means save to crd file in new key, this may be easier than
        than saving back to default key but should always be
        "Save As" because many song files will use the key as part
        of the file name.

 - allow single instance of chorus or other part to show more than once.
    - Allow order list
    - Allow sidebar (or top) TOC for instant switching to part (add hot keys)
    - Allow defining parts
         - use meta tags for verse/chorus/bridge
            - use recognized {c: } comments... maybe add conversion
    - or... allow back to go back to page with chorus, then forward to
        place in song before going back. Or both but this may be easier
        to implement first and would sure be nice.

 - Import PDFs
    - This is a nightmare as some pdfs are images while others have
        raw text. Each type of pdf will need to be detected:
        - Image. seems hopeless but we should be able to have an editor
            that breaks the pdf into:
                - front page header
                - sections: verses, chorus(es), etc.
            these images can then be inserted into html for display.
            we could possibly use this for direct to pager use.
            I do not know if OCR libs would allow keeping chord to
            lyric alignment or even current spacing intact.
        - Chords over lyrics - needs dekerning. Many chords over lyrics
            do not use monospace fonts to allow lining up the chord
            line to the lyric line which would make conversion to
            crd easier. Hopefully any pdf lib we use would allow
            other tricks to be used to "table" them.
        - Tabled. If we can truely detect this, we should be able to
            convert to crd. Lots of work and probably a whole lib.
            most PDF charts I have found in the wild (that are not
            scans/images) are tabled but most pdf to text utilities
            just show the list of table data sections with no end of
            table row indication. I am hoping using a pdf lib
            directly will give this info.
        - While chord over lyrics or tabled could be displayed
            directly, this is suboptimal. Converting to chordpro
            would allow the user to edit, save, change the default
            key, change keys on the fly.
    - At least allow inserting a pdf in a setlist and paging it
        - allow editing into smaller pages of verse and chorus
        - pypdf can crop pdfs to smaller ones maybe at least to verses,
            chorus, intro, bridge etc. These can then be windowed using
            the flow widget in a scroller as html.

 - import docx, odt, etc.  Maybe later, this is just an idea but many
    people do not have any understanding of the difference between
    a text editor, document processor, mono space or kerned fonts, etc.
    making this conversion less easy.
    - check catdoc docx2txt pandoc antiword
        these are utilities for dealing with doc/docx file
     - All of these import ideas could use some sort of de-kern of
        spaces in the chord line 32spaces equals 20 spaces? 10:16... so
        count spaces and divide by 1.6?
 - network
    - add webserver that follows server's paging. So that a number of
        people can follow the same chart on their phone. This is
        complex requiring a dhcp server, nameserver, or zero(whatever)
        setup as well as the web server that has to allow
        multi-directional comunication so that anyone can push page
        changes and song change (hopefully only one person at a time)
        - allow browser to select keys for setlist
        - allow browser to show capo for user. Or kb player to set an
            odd key where they are transposed to. While at the same time
            allowing to change over all key.
        - allow another instance to send/receive songs and setlists
        - allow another instance to send/receive paging
