Installing MusicPager
==========================

In general Ubuntu and derivatives will have all the packages needed to
run music pager except for:
    gir1.2-webkit2
    weasyprint
    python3-rtmidi

If there are more your distro doesn't come with let me know and I will
add them to this list.

in a terminal enter:

sudo make install

The standard install is into /usr/local/*
Packagers can make use of the ‘PREFIX’ and ‘DESTDIR’ variable during install, like this:
$ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=./test-dir

To remove:

sudo make uninstall

Note: if PREFIX= or DESTDIR= were used for install then they must be used
        for uninstall as well
