Music Pager

An application For performing musicians that displays chord charts
and allows page turning for multiple pages. The input files are
expected to be chordpro formatted. See www.chordpro.org for more
details of file format. The chordpro utility from this site is also
very useful for turning chordpro files into PDF files and converting
text files with chord over lyrics to chordpro files.... though some
hand editing may be needed.

Musicpager does not support all chordpro directives yet but more will
be added as we go. However, it seems that most downloadable chordpro
files display in a usable fashion.

See the INSTALL file for instalation instructions
